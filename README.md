My conky and Fluxbox themes.

Both have some elements inspired by other themes in their respective categories, however the majority of the content is my own. For my Fluxbox theme, my taskbar and slit are inspired by the Squared theme (found on box-look.org) but menu and window decorations are my own. The theme.cfg was designed for 1080p resolution so you may need to adjust the taskbar and window heights if you use 4K resolution. Weather data is pulled from Environment Canada using their RSS feed data which is easily parsed with this bash script which I stumbled across here: https://github.com/rlafuente/textan/blob/master/conky-rss.sh. The degree symbol doesn't seem to translate from the parsed data/terminal/conky, so I opted to modify the script and added "sed -e 's/&#xB0;//' |\" without the quotes above the 'head' line which cuts out that symbol. The temperature already includes the C for Celsius so I wasn't too concerned about keeping the degree symbol, otherwise if any of you have a workaround i'm open to hearing your solution.

You will need to edit the conkyrc file to use your own RSS feed data for your location, otherwise the only other (optional) additions are the fonts. The Sony Sketch font is included in a number of Fluxbox themes found at www.box-look.org, and the digital font I found here: https://www.wfonts.com/font/digital.

Feel free to use/modify to your liking, and please try to credit any original authors or sources for borrowed elements.
